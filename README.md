# Terrigenesis
## BTW, This is a great name

The goal of this project is to have a fully capable server run on a Raspberry Pi, in my dorm, which enables to me to send, download and maneuver any file, any time, from the terminal of my laptop, to this server.

Language-wise, `Go` is the chosen one. No questions asked. Setup guide is at [How to write Go code?](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
